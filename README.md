This repository is dedicated to publishing ex-ante predictions (with probability estimates) for tennis matches using our graph neural network model, found at (HASH).

This will serve as a live demonstration for our forthcoming paper [Tennis match outcome prediction using temporal directed graph neural networks](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/tennis-match-outcome-prediction-using-temporal-directed-graph-neu), available at [11th MathSport International Conference Proceedings 2025](https://math.uni.lu/midas/events/mathsports2025/).

## Tournaments 

The predictions will cover [every match from all Grand Slam and ATP Masters 1000 tournaments held on Clay courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_ATP_Tour) starting with the Monte-Carlo Masters and ending with the French Open, also known as Roland-Garros:

1. **Monte Carlo Masters (ATP Masters 1000)**: April 6 - April 13, 2025
2. **Madrid Open (ATP Masters 1000)**: April 21 - May 4, 2025
3. **Rome Masters (ATP Masters 1000)**: May 7 - May 18, 2025
4. **Roland Garros (Grand Slam)**: May 25 - June 8, 2025


## Features

- **Match Predictions**: We will provide forecasts for upcoming tennis matches, including probability estimates for each outcome.
- **Live Updates**: New predictions will be published before each tournament round, ensuring no lookahead bias.
- **CSV Format**: Predictions will be saved in the easily accesible CSV format.



## Usage

Feel free to access the CSV files to view predictions and track the model's performance over time. As the repository is updated, you will be able to see the latest predictions and accuracy metrics.

Stay tuned for the public release of the model.
