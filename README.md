This repository is dedicated to publishing predictions (with probability estimates) [ante-post] for tennis matches using our graph neural network model, found at (HASH).

This will serve as a live-test for our upcoming paper [Tennis match outcome prediction using temporal directed graph neural networks](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/tennis-match-outcome-prediction-using-temporal-directed-graph-neu), [mathsport information]


## Tournaments 

The predictions will cover [clay] matches from the following tournaments (all Grand Slam and Master 1000 ATP matches):


## Features

- **Match Predictions**: We will provide forecasts for upcoming tennis matches, including probability estimates for each outcome.
- **CSV Publication**: Predictions will be published in CSV format, allowing for easy access and analysis.
- **Live Updates**: The repository will feature live updates before each tournament round, ensuring no lookahead bias.


## Usage

Users can access the CSV files to view predictions and track the model's performance over time. As the repository is updated, users will be able to see the latest predictions and accuracy metrics.

Stay tuned for the public release of the model.
